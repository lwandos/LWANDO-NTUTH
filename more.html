                    <p>
                        After an epic journey during which it travelled 16,000 miles over the course of 60+ days from South Korea, 
                        Argos  ̶  the centerpiece of bp’s $9 billion Mad Dog 2 project in the US Gulf of Mexico  ̶  has docked at the 
                        Kiewit Offshore Services fabrication yard in Ingleside, Texas.
                
                        The arrival of the new floating production unit (FPU), transported onboard the Boskalis BOKA Vanguard heavy
                         transport vessel, marks a major milestone towards the completion of Mad Dog 2. At peak, Argos is expected
                          to produce up to 140,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) through a subsea production system 
                          from up to 14 production wells. This will boost bp’s production capacity in the region by an estimated 25%.
                    
                        The Mad Dog 2 project demonstrates bp’s commitment to resilient, focused hydrocarbons – an essential
                         component of its strategy to transform into an integrated energy company. bp aims to access and deliver 
                         new barrels at lower cost and in rapid time by focusing on the basins it knows best.

                    <p>The first of 21 vast concrete caissons for a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in West Africa has sailed away 
                        from Dakar Harbour to offshore Goree Island, where it will be moored before being transported to the project’s
                         hub terminal site later this summer.
 

                        The GTA gas field, located around 120 kilometres offshore on the maritime border between Mauritania and
                         Senegal, is forecast to play a role in generating revenue and contributing to domestic energy supply in
                          the countries. The field, being developed by bp and partners, has an estimated capacity of 15 trillion
                           cubic feet of gas.</p>
